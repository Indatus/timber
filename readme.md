Timber
======

Timber provides a lean wrapper around the default logging utility built into Android.

A `TAG` is auto-generated for you and your log statement is prefaced by `[method:line]`.  This was inspired by [DebugLog](https://github.com/MustafaFerhan/DebugLog).

Usage
-----

    Timber.v("Logging a verbose message...");

Will output something like this in logcat:

    V/com.indatus.android.timber.sample.MainActivityï¹• [onClick:30] Logginga verbose message...

Each of the verbosity levels from the default Log apply here:

- `Timber.v(...)`
- `Timber.d(...)`
- `Timber.i(...)`
- `Timber.w(...)`
- `Timber.e(...)`
- `Timber.wtf(...)`

### A Note on Performance

For improved performance, Timber was designed to use varargs rather than a single string.  Passing in multiple parameters will be more efficient if you separate them with a comma and let Timber handle the concatenation for you.

    Timber.d("Server response: ", response);

is preferable to:

    Timber.d("Server response: " + response);

The reasoning behind this has to do with the way an object's `toString()` method works.  If `response` in this case were a `StringBuilder`, which it often would be when collecting a server response, it would automatically call `response.toString()` so a single concatenated String can be passed in as the parameter.  So why is this a problem?  Let's suppose for a minute that `response` is fairly large in size.  Calling `toString()` (either explicitly or letting it be called implicitly) will create unnecessary overhead for a log statement that isn't even going to get executed in a release build.  Passing `response` to Timber as an argument (the first example) delays the `toString()` call until it's needed, thereby reducing wasted performance in your production app, but still providing you with important information when debugging.
